# LazySliderWithBarcodeScanner
This is a java script image slider with lazy loading + a barcode scanner that runs on a local machine with no internet connection.

**The project**
A friend of mine that works for a school wanted a system where student can scan barcode cards that will be given to them by teachers and see if they won something.
**The lazy load slider**
The slider works with js and only loads 2 img elements at a time so not to overload the mini pc it was running on.
**Dynamic image slider**
The slider is designed to load images from a folder as long as its numbered sequentially starting at one and a prompt on load sets the amount  of slides to load.
**Barcode card scanner**
The barcode scanner is basically a key press listener which reads barcode inputs and displays a message accordingly when triggered by the barcode return character
